# FreeCycle

## Inspiration
The community resources are conserved and waste is minimized through the exchange and reuse of goods. We  are building a strong and interconnected community that values sustainability and takes action to create a healthier planet.
Our purpose is to build a sustainable and interconnected community by promoting the exchange and reuse of goods. We aim to reduce waste and conserve resources by facilitating the trading of goods between individuals in our community. Through our platform, we seek to inspire our community to embrace a circular economy that prioritizes reuse and recycling. Our goal is to foster a strong and collaborative community that values sustainability, and leads the way in creating a healthier planet for generations to come.
## What it does
This website create an environment where users can exchange goods like clothes, kitchen appliances, tools, etc (excluding food and perishables) within their county. 

## How we built it

We built a cross platform mobile app using Flutter, powered by a Firebase backend. We setup Firebase authentication to ensure secure storage of user info, and used Firebase Cloud Functions to ensure we keep developer credentials locked away in our secure cloud. We used the CapitalOne Hackathon API to simulate bank accounts, transactions between bank accounts and withdrawals.
