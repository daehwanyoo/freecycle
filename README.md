# FreeCycle

## Inspiration
We believe that reducing waste is crucial in the fight against environmental degradation, and it threats to the human health. We acknowledge the problem and formed a team to work towards reducing waste by creating a FreeCycle. FreeCycle stops waste and promotes recycling, reusing, and repurposing our "trash".

Our purpose is to build a sustainable and interconnected community by promoting the exchange and reuse of goods. We aim to reduce waste and conserve resources by facilitating the trading of goods between individuals in our community. Through our platform, we seek to inspire our community to embrace a circular economy that prioritizes reuse and recycling. Our goal is to foster a strong and collaborative community that values sustainability, and leads the way in creating a healthier planet for generations to come.

## What it does
This website builds an environment where users can exchange goods within the following categories: Electronics & Media, Home & Garden, Clothing, Shoes & Accessories, Baby & Kids, Video Games, Sports & Outdoors, Collectibles & Art, Pet Supplies, Health & Beauty, and Tools & Equipment. Our users will use FreeCycle to access other community members trying to exchange goods within the same ZIP code.

## Why the same ZIP code
FreeCycle's mission is to make create a better and healthier future. We believe in "Small solutions to big problems". Communities trading and working together will drastically reduce the waste communities produced, which will create an interconnected community that aims to reduce waste and conserve resources.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
We faced many challenges while creating Free Cycle. Our main challenge were implementing API, using a database on a website, and integrating a Google authentication system. These tasks require a good understanding of the technologies involved and best practices for their implementation. Implementing API involves complex data exchange mechanisms, working with databases requires careful management to avoid data loss or corruption, and integrating Google authentication requires careful security considerations. However, these features can greatly enhance website functionality and security when executed with careful planning.
